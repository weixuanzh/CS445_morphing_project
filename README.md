# CS445_morphing_project

Dataset for face morphing:
300W: 
A dataset for facial landmark detection, with face images and labelled landmarks.
Raw face images can also be used for manual key point picking and morphing.
https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/300-W/

AFW:
similar to 300W, contains face images and labelled landmarks.
This dataset is more challenging, as multiple faces appear in one image.
May not be suitable for morphing, but good for training landmark detection models.

Helen:
